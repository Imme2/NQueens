# NQueens

Just a few examples on how to solve the NQueens problem in Python.

i'll be publishing both the Backtracking solution and one with a metaheuristic called Minimum conflicts.

This repo is just for my own practice, but you're free to take the code and use it however you want.

I take no responsability for how you use this code.
